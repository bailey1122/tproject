An application which applies a multiple file (or one file) REST request. It  reads a local folder and finds a user-defined file. After that Kafka consumes output of the first line of a file and puts it into the command line. The file has an opportunity to be loaded to a FTP server as well. The application handles requests correctly by HTTPStatus and an user-defined exception. All operations are kept track by Log4j.
